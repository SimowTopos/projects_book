Some of them are collaboration work under my supervision and tutoring.

## Internship at SNCF 2003

Author : [Mohamed Alaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-alaoui-simon/?locale=en_US)

Second-Year Engineering Internship: Automatic Generation of Signal/Speed Diagrams Using AutoCAD
This project aimed to study the behavior of TGV drivers by analyzing data extracted from the trains' black boxes.
It was my first professional experience in software engineering, where I gained valuable skills in:

Object-oriented programming with C++
Database management using Oracle DBMS
Software engineering tools and methodologies

## Internship at INRIA 2004

Author : [Mohamed Alaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-alaoui-simon/?locale=en_US)

Final year engineering school internship carried out at INRIA Bordeaux in the high-performance computing team  ([scalapplix](https://www.labri.fr/projet/scalapplix/) devenue [hiepacs](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/) puis [concace](https://concace.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) et [topal](https://www.inria.fr/fr/topal))

The project focused on complex multi-scale simulations based on partial differential equations, which are highly resource-intensive. The study specifically addressed the parallelization of adaptive mesh refinement algorithms, optimizing computational efficiency by concentrating efforts on the most critical regions of the mesh. This was achieved using a divide-and-conquer strategy, allowing for parallel processing while overlapping communication with computation to minimize downtime.

This internship was part of my research master's program, enabling me to fulfill the requirements for both my engineering degree at ENSEIRB and my DEA (research master's) at the University of Bordeaux I. The subject bridged multiple disciplines, including physics, mathematics, computer science, and software engineering.
