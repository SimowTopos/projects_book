## Fast Read Solomon algo used for ZK-STARK written in rust in 2024

FRI is a powerful algorithm used in various fields, including cryptography and error correction. By leveraging polynomial encoding, FRI allows for efficient verification of constraints to proof some claimed computations.
FRI is used in Zero Knowledge Proof STARK protocole.

## Liatrust White Paper in 2019

Main Author : [Mohamed Alaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-alaoui-simon/?locale=en_US)
The contributors are mentionned in the white paper

The Liatrust white paper outlines a method for managing documents as certificates to assert ownership of specific actions. A key use case is the certificate of origin, commonly used in international supply chains.

The white paper presents a distributed ledger solution incorporating a Multi-Party Computing (MPC) wallet to securely manage the private keys of the various actors involved. These actors are responsible for issuing, validating, and viewing the certificates, ensuring security and transparency throughout the process.

English version is comming soon or you can add an issue in this repo so I can do translation asap.

## Internet of Things Certification Project in 2018

Author : [Mohamed Alaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-alaoui-simon/?locale=en_US)

As part of an IOT certification at Ecole Polytechnique, I developped an IOT prototype based on BLE to stress test a data acquisition system to monitor various crop types.

## Internship at INRIA 2004

Author : [Mohamed Alaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-alaoui-simon/?locale=en_US)

Final year engineering school internship carried out at INRIA Bordeaux in the high-performance computing team  ([scalapplix](https://www.labri.fr/projet/scalapplix/) devenue [hiepacs](https://team.inria.fr/hiepacs/) puis [concace](https://concace.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) et [topal](https://www.inria.fr/fr/topal))

The project focused on complex multi-scale simulations based on partial differential equations, which are highly resource-intensive. The study specifically addressed the parallelization of adaptive mesh refinement algorithms, optimizing computational efficiency by concentrating efforts on the most critical regions of the mesh. This was achieved using a divide-and-conquer strategy, allowing for parallel processing while overlapping communication with computation to minimize downtime.

This internship was part of my research master's program, enabling me to fulfill the requirements for both my engineering degree at ENSEIRB and my DEA (research master's) at the University of Bordeaux I. The subject bridged multiple disciplines, including physics, mathematics, computer science, and software engineering.

## Internship at SNCF 2003

Author : [Mohamed Alaoui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamed-alaoui-simon/?locale=en_US)

Second-Year Engineering Internship: Automatic Generation of Signal/Speed Diagrams Using AutoCAD
This project aimed to study the behavior of TGV drivers by analyzing data extracted from the trains' black boxes.
It was my first professional experience in software engineering, where I gained valuable skills in:

Object-oriented programming with C++
Database management using Oracle DBMS
Software engineering tools and methodologies
